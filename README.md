# Constellation by Teleportal

Constellation is a time-sampled and realtime data model and spatial computing
library. For more info, reach out to us as [hello@teleportal.app][hello email].


## License

All code in this repository is available under either a [commercial license] or the
open source [Affero GPL v3][AGPL] license, at your choice. This means you can pick
which one you prefer!


### Motivations for dual licensing

The AGPL is not compatible for use in proprietary, closed-source codebases. We
acknowledge that many applications that build on our software will not be able to
to disclose their source code, which is why we would like to provide a more permissive
license. Unfortunately, we also need to balance our interest in providing a permissive
license with protecting our financial viability as a small startup. For this reason,
we have chosen the dual FOSS-commercial licensing approach.
