# Contributing

Thank you for helping design the future of spatial computing! This document describes
what you need to know to contribute to this project.

## Contributor License Agreement

We ask each contributor to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The CLA doesn't
change any of your rights to your own contribution, but it does allow us to relicense
the code for commercial uses on a case by case basis.

You'll only need to sign the CLA once! Our bot will comment on your PR with instructions
on how to sign the CLA.

The CLA can be found [here][CLA].

## Documentation

Documentation from the rust source code can be generated and viewed with
`cargo doc --all --no-deps --document-private-items --open`.

Internal design docs are not yet publicly accessible.
